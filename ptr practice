The variables arr1 and arr2 have been declared as pointers to integers.

An array of 10 elements has been allocated,
its pointer assigned to arr1, and
the elements initialized to some values.

Allocate an array of 20 elements,
assign its pointer to arr2,
copy the 10 elements from arr1 to the first 10 elements of arr2, and
initialize the remainder of the elements of arr2 to 0.



arr2=new int[20];
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
    arr2[i]=arr1[i];
}
for(int i=10;i<20;i++)
{
    arr2[i]=0;
}
